# Fair Housing Elements

Every eight years, cities in California create a plan to build housing across the income spectrum. State regulators have provided new guidance on a city's duty to **affirmatively further fair housing.** Legally, cities are required to considered all aspects of how their housing plan impacts protected classes of people, whether that's by creating de jure segregation or by placing low income families in areas with greater pollution.

Given a **site inventory** - viz. a list of parcels of land suitable for housing production - the code in this repository will report how the site inventory scores in terms of fair housing metrics, e.g. environmental justice and equal access to amenities from park space to quality schools.
